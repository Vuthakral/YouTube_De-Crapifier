# YouTube_De-Crapifier
I can only handle so many annoyances before my patience is gone.

This is a Firefox extension that "de-crapifies" YouTube. It does the following:

- Restores the homepage to have six videos shown per row
- Hides shorts on the homepage
- Hides banners on the homepage (sports, politics, "breaking news", etc)
- Prevents opening a video from automatically opening a "mix playlist" despite not being a playlist. (This is the straw the broke the camel's back)
- Hides the "end screen" on videos (The video recommendation + large channel icon that often gets in the way of the video's ending)
- Removes tracker URLs from embeds & from generated shared video links.
